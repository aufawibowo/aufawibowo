### Hi there, i'm Aufa (he/him)

I'm a Software Engineer with a product-first mindset in mind. I believe that delivering software solutions should bring value to the users hence driving business and product metrics.

With my current enriching experience in Software Engineering, I spent most of my career on SaaS B2B products (point of sales, micro-SMEs agent-networked app, and accountant as a service for B2B). I deliver software solutions for user and business needs.

While most of my time I spent in post-PMF companies, I also have been on a venture working on a pre-PMF startup reaching its PMF.
